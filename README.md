# coding_challenges

This repository contains my solutions to coding problems across various websites (for now hackerrank only).

Disclaimer: The folder and file naming is bad, I know, but it helps navigating through problems, by being identical to the actual problem titles

# Coding Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to coding challenges primarily from HackerRank. The challenges range from algorithms to data structures and more.

## Disclaimer

The folder and file naming might not be conventional, but they mirror the actual sub-domains and problem titles on HackerRank for ease of navigation.

## Technologies Used

- Programming Languages: Go, C

## Getting Started

To run any Go solution, navigate to the specific folder and run: go test .
